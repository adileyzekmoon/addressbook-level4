== Loading the sample data

Create a folder `data` in the directory where from where the jar file is going to be run. Rename the `SampleData.xml`
file to `addressbook.xml` and copy it to the newly created `data` folder. When you run the application, 20 contacts
will be loaded

== Outline
The test cases are designed so that each category of tests is self contained, meaning that completing one of them
does not influence the outcome of the other tests. If you perform individual tests from a category, it might be in
conflict with the assumptions about the current state of the data.

== Test cases

=== Grouping

==== add to a group successfully

* command: `group 2 gn/CS2103`
* expected behavior: the second person on the list is successfully added to the group `CS2103`

==== add to a group that contains spaces successfully

* command: `group 2 gn/University NUS`
* expected behavior: the second person on the list is successfully added to the group `University NUS`

==== try to add to a group to which the person already belongs

* command: `group 2 gn/CS2103`
* expected behavior: relevant error message is issued

==== try to add to a group with empty string as a name

* command: `group 2 gn/`
* expected behavior: relevant error message is issued

==== try to remove from a group to which the person does not belong

* command: `ungroup 2 gn/CS2104`
* expected behavior: relevant error message is issued

==== try to remove from a group by specifying a name with wrong capitalization

* command: `ungroup 2 gn/university`
* expected behavior: relevant error message is issued

==== try to remove from a group by specifying empty string as a name

* command: `ungroup 2 gn/`
* expected behavior: relevant error message is issued

==== remove from a group successfully

* command: `ungroup 2 gn/University NUS`
* command: `ungroup 2 gn/CS2104`
* expected behavior: the second person on the list is successfully from the groups `University NUS` and `CS2104`

=== Property - always sorted

==== add a person so that the app inserts the card in the right order

* command: `add n/Zbigniew Zaniewicz p/45342342 e/zz@gmail.com a/Podniebna 24, 20-738 Lublin`
* expected behavior: the person is inserted on the 20th position, properly

==== filter the persons so that the selected persons are listed sorted

* command: `filter hasMyPencil`
* expected behavior: 4 sorted entries are displayed

==== cleanup after test

* command: `list`
* command: `delete 20`

=== Remove tag
